# Form Enhancer

This user script adds email address validation and address auto-complete to many forms across the web.

## Installation

1. Make sure you are using either [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox). Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge will not work.

2. Install either [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) or [Tampermonkey for FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/). This add-on allows for custom userscripts to be installed, which you will do in the next steps.

3. Install the [Form Enhancer userscript](https://github.com/hexarobi/tm-form-enhancer/raw/master/form-enhancer.user.js) by opening the link and clicking the "Install" button on the page. This will enable email validation, address autocomplete, and name auto-capitalization.

4. Install the [QuickSearchBar userscript](https://github.com/hexarobi/tm-form-enhancer/raw/master/tm-quicksearch-bar.user.js) the same way as before. This enables a QuickSearch bar on the right side of the form for looking up info by name/phone/address.

That's it! Go refresh your forms and you should notice new features. You can disable/reenable the script under the Tampermonkey menu.
